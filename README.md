# Basic SQL Data Analysis Demonstration

---

### Objective: Use SQL queries to extract and analyze data from a database.

### Tools Used: MySQL

### Dataset: [ClassicModels Sample Database](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-sample-database.aspx)

---

## ðŸ›  Deliverables
The following SQL operations were implemented for demonstration purposes:  

1. **SELECT + WHERE + ORDER BY** â€“ Filtering customers by country.  
2. **GROUP BY + Aggregate (SUM)** â€“ Calculating customer spending.  
3. **INNER JOIN** â€“ Linking orders with customer details.  
4. **LEFT JOIN** â€“ Retrieving products with order details (including products not ordered).  
5. **RIGHT JOIN** â€“ Retrieving all products with their order usage.  
6. **Subquery** â€“ Customers with recent orders.  
7. **Aggregate (AVG)** â€“ Average order value.  
8. **CREATE VIEW** â€“ Precomputed customer spending view.  
9. **CREATE INDEX** â€“ Optimizing queries by indexing `customerNumber` in orders.
